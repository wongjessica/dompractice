<p>The onclick event is used to trigger a function when an element is clicked on.</p>

<button onclick="myFunction()">Button #1</button> <span id = "demo"> </span> <br> <br>

<!--Makes Button#1 and a span is added to make the text appear next to button-->

<button onclick="myFunction2()">Button #2</button> 

<!--Makes Button#2, myFunction is the effect of pressing the button-->

<p id="demo"></p>

<script> 
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "I'm Right";
}

</script>

<script>
function myFunction2() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "No, I'm Right";
}
</script>
